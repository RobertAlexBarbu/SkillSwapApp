# SkillSwapApp
"SkillSwap" â€“ A Local Skills Exchange Platform

SkillSwap addresses the issue where people have valuable skills to share but may not have the financial resources to pay for the services they need. The app creates a space where users can exchange skills or services without the use of money, fostering community connections and enabling users to get things done by helping each other.

## Features
1. **User Registration and Login**  
   Users can sign up and log in.  
   Each user creates a profile listing the skills they can offer and the skills or services they are seeking in return.

2. **Skill/Service Listings**  
   Users can post the skills they are offering and the services they are seeking.  
   Listings include descriptions to help others understand the offering.

3. **Matching and Requests**  
   Users can browse available posts and send requests to initiate a skill swap.

4. **Notifications**  
   Firebase Cloud Messaging notifies users when someone is interested in their offer or sends a skill swap request.  
   Users also receive notifications when a swap is confirmed.
