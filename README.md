# SkillSwapApp
"SkillSwap" â€“ A Local Skills Exchange Platform
SkillSwap addresses the issue where people have valuable skills to share but may not have the financial resources to pay for the services they need. The app creates a space where users can exchange skills or services without the use of money, fostering community connections and enabling users to get things done by helping each other.
User Registration and Login:
Users can sign up and log in using Firebase Authentication. Each user has a profile listing the skills they can offer  and the skills or services they are seeking in return.
Skill/Service Listings:
Users can post the skills they are offering and the services they are seeking.
Matching and Requests:
Users can browse posts and send a request to initiate a skill swap. When a suitable match is found, such as tutoring in exchange for graphic design, they can easily request a swap.
Notifications:
Firebase Cloud Messaging notifies users when someone expresses interest in their offer or sends a skill swap request. Notifications also alert users when a swap is confirmed.
